Easily host a party or event at the touch of a button - okay a few buttons - without using facebook! Use Loop to create an event on the fly, without any preparation, so that you can be the host of a spontaneous event for all your friends and family. No more annoying notifications from facebook bogging you down - just a clean, simple experience that only handles events.

# MVP

  - Open the app and login or register.
  - Click a button to start an event (captures your location)
  - Optional fields to provide details about the event (purpose, time, supplies, etc.)
  - Share the event with your contacts.
  - Party

## Technology and Approach

I have decided to build this application using MongoDB, Express, React and Node. The reason behind this is mostly because I have the most experience writing javascript code over anything else, and because I want to use this project to familiarize myself with writing Node/React and using a NoSQL style database. I understand that the correct decision is always to use the technology that best solves the problem, but in this case, I believe that there are many possible tech stack solutions that can get the job done. That said, my vision for this application is for it to be mobile in its final form due to the fact that this app aims to solve the issue of wanting to start an event spontaneously, and since we have our phones with us almost all the time, it will be easier to act on that spontaneity with a mobile device rather than a laptop or desktop.

### Development

If this idea sounds cool to you, please offer feedback, criticism, solutions, etc. I have tried to start a business around this idea in the past, and it failed because I wasn't a developer at the time. I'm new to software development now, but rather than trying to profit from the success of this application, I just want it to exist so people can use it to start events quickly and easily. Something like it should already exist, imo.
